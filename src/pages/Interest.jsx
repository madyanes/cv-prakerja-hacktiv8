        I am interested in web technologies that allow us to exchange
        information quickly with little physical effort. Not only that, but we
        can choose to have that information displayed in the interface we want.
        I love coding, but am less skilled at design. Fortunately, that is the
        domain of a UI/UX developer, not the job of a coder or web developer. So
        I can apply my coding skills to the needs of building UIs from designs
        provided by UI/UX developers with great interest.

        Besides that, I also like playing online games with my friends because I
        think it can serve as a medium to keep in touch wherever and whenever.
